# Shortest-PathFinder-Visualizer

### This a shortest pathFinder visualization system written in C++ which is especially built for hospitals and oxygen-supply-center for quicker supply of oxygen cyclinder by following the shortest path.

### It makes use of All Pair shortest path algorithm i.e Floyd Warshall Algorithm to find the shortest path between source and destination. It makes us of an algorithmic paradigm called Dynammic Programming for efficient calculation of shortest path.

### In order to indicate the shortest path from source to destination, we have made use of c++ graphics which highlights the resultant shortest path with different colour, in this case it is GREEN.
